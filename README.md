# Cryptocurrency ETL Pipeline
## _Using Coingecko API_

## Business case
Our team wants to be able to categorize the crypto currencies, and be able to query top coins for each category for research purposes.

# Connect:
We will be using Coingecko API

# Storage:
We will use S3 as the sink

# Compute:
Since the data is not large, we will use AWS lambda as compute

# Visualization:
We want to be able to visualize the data in 3 different ways:
- Dashboard (tableau or powerBI)
- Raw query (can be amazon athena)
- simple UI (streamlit)
